This project implements a simple game of poker. The player bets between 1 and 5 tokens, they are is dealt a hand, and then asked which cards they would like to discard. 
Subsequently, the player is dealt new cards to replace the ones they discarded (assuming they disacrded to begin with). Then, the hand is checked and the player wins or loses according to the amount they bet.
