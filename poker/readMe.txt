In the card class, I initialized each card with a suit and rank. The card class also  includes a compareTo method which compares the suits and ranks of each card to sort them in the game class. Lastly, a toString method printed each card as a string. 
In the deck class, I created a deck ArrayList of 52 cards. There’s also shuffle and deal methods which shuffles the deck and deals the top card of the deck, respectively. 
In the player class, I created the player's hand and bankroll, and methods to manipulate them. The winnings and losings methods manipulate the player’s winnings or losings and then updates their bankroll. 
In the game class, the poker game is played. Two constructors are used: one for the command line and one not. The checkHand method reads the player's hand and determines what the hand is.
In order to play through the command line, write each hand like such: s1 s13 s12 s11 s10	
In order to play a normal game of poker, follow these steps: The player bets between 1 and 5 tokens. Then the player will be asked which cards they would like to remove. After, a revised hand is given to the player. Then, the hand is checked and the player wins or loses the proper amount.
